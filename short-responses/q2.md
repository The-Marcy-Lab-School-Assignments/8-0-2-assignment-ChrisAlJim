# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer

Environment variables are variable that hold sensitive information outside of the Javascript execution content. We access these variables by installing the dotenv dependency. Then on the .env file we store whatever data that is sensitive.

```js
data = "(0-0)/";
```

Wherever we need to access that data we can do so with these lines of code.

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const data = process.env.data;
```

# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

The danger of making an API request with API keys from the frontend is that it has a possibility of being accessed by someone else and using our API request resources. If someone has the deployed version of our application they can check the Network tab on inspect tp see the request containing the key.

Making an API request from the server avoids this danger by making a request to the server so that the call does not display our API key. The server then makes the request using the API key. A user with a deployed version will not have access to the server.
